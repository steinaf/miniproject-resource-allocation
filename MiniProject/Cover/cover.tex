\begin{abstract} 
Current large distributed systems allow users to share and trade resources. In cloud computing, users purchase different resources like network bandwidth, computing power and storage system from one or more cloud providers for a limited period of time with a variable or fixed price. Federated cloud is a mechanism for sharing resources thereby increasing scalability. An improved algorithm has been devised in which a multi-agent system consisting of Consumer Agents, Broker Agents and Resource Provider Agents work in tandem to provide the consumer with the desired resources with maximum efficiency. In this system, the user need not know where the resources reside or who is providing them.
